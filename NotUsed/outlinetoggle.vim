" History:
" [Feral:267/02@05:43] v0.03:
" saves the old marker method now.
" stoped trying to be clever (just do the command twice heh)
" v0.02
" trys to be clever and start in the proper outline mode based on if it
" finds a "{>>" in the file.
" [Rajas:07/16/04] v0.04.1:
" Combined feral's tip with the foldcolumn method and cleaned out comments
" from ferals code. Changed commands name to FOLD (shorter :)

"Here's a function to toggle the use of syntax-based folding for a c/c++/java file. It also handles folding markers.

function! <SID>OutlineToggle()
let OldLine = line(".")
let OldCol = virtcol(".")
if (! exists ("b:outline_mode"))
let b:outline_mode = 0
let b:OldMarker = &foldmarker
endif


if (b:outline_mode == 0)
let b:outline_mode = 1
set foldmethod=marker
set foldmarker={,}
silent! exec "%s/{{{/{<</"
silent! exec "%s/}}}/}>>/"
set foldcolumn=4
else
let b:outline_mode = 0
set foldmethod=marker
let &foldmarker=b:OldMarker
silent! exec "%s/{<</{{{/"
silent! exec "%s/}>>/{{{/"

endif
